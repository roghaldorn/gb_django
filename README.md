Django
Django, have you always been alone?
Django
Django, have you never loved again?
Love will live on
Life must go on
For you cannot spend your life regreatting
Django
Django, you must face another day
Django
Django, now your love has gone away
Once you loved her
Now you've lost her
But you've lost her forever, Django
When there are clouds in the skies and they are grey
You may be sad, but remember they'll all soon pass away
Oh Django, after the showers the sun will be shining
Once you loved her
Now you've lost her
But you've lost her forever, Django
When there are clouds in the skies and they are grey
You may be sad, but remember they'll all soon pass away
Oh Django, after the showers the sun will be shining
Django
Oh, oh, oh, Django
You must go on
Oh, oh, oh, Django
